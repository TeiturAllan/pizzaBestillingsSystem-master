the menu.ejs file can seem a little daunting at first however the structure of the file
is rather simple.
the first 200 lines are pure ejs (embeded JavaScript) that is used to determine the
values that are to input in the the different HTML tags; the rest of the file is pretty straight forward HTML and CSS. 
this is done with a large forEach loop that loops through each of menu items defined in the menu JSON files (menuBurger.JSON, menuKids.JSON and menuPizza.JSON).
this forEach loop goes through each of the attributes of each of the objects (menu items) and uses them to assign the relevant values.
An example not every pizza has beef on it and therefor the input tag for beef should only be 1 (meaning 1 portion of beef, if the customer wants extra or no beef then he/she can click on
the + or - span) when the pizza is supposed to have beef on it, and it should be 0 when there is not supposed to be any beef on the pizza.
