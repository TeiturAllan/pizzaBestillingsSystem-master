if you want to translate the system into a different language, then the you only have to change the labels on the EJS/HTML file, to be the desired language for the customer

if you wish to change the system for the backend staff aswell, such as cooks, then you only need to change the value of each ingredient before they are pushed to the menuItemTransformedData array on the '/:menuItemCategory/addItemToCart' POST request in the menuRouter.js page.
