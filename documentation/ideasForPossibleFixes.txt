to fix the order cart problem, i can use an empty array (within a script tag) on an HTML file, as that file is loaded on to each client and is therefor client specific
which means that there is no risk of two clients seeing the same order. E.g. if client A adds a pizza to his cart, it will not be added to client B's cart. 

to make this cart persistent i can try to add the cart
